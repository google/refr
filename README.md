# ReFr (Reranker Framework)

ReFr is a software architecture for specifying, training and using
reranking models. Reranking models take the n-best output of some
existing system and produce new scores for each of the n hypotheses
that potentially induce a different ranking, ideally yielding better
results than the original system. The Reranker Framework (**ReFr** for
short) has some special support for building discriminative language
models, but can be applied to any reranking problem.
